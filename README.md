# quizGen

**quizGen** is a React.js-based quiz generator designed to aid in studying for my personal AWS certifications. Leveraging the cost-effective DeepSeek API, this application generates personalized quizzes to help reinforce learning material efficiently.

Many online quiz generators impose restrictions, such as limiting the number of uses per account. The need for a more accessible and affordable solution led to the development of `quizGen`, offering a simple, close to no-cost alternative to traditional quiz platforms.
